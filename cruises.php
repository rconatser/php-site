            <p>There just isn’t enough vacation time to do everything, so you go for the widest variety, make the most of the moments… and above all, try to have the most fun whenever possible. All of you with the heads nodding, hands raised, folks who just stood up and cheered at the office — you’re our people! Our newest ship is packing all the best, most delicious fun from her sister ships, but still manages to stand out. The Breeze sails from Long Beach, California — our first brand-new ship to grace the port in 20 years! This means L.A. style for sure, but this ship visits top spots across Mexico’s postcard-perfect Pacific coast: names like Puerto Vallarta, Cabo San Lucas and more...</p>

            <p>The line that brings the sea and the sky together inspired us... to build a ship that unites you with great fun, comfort, dining and exotic destinations. And most importantly, unites you with one another. It's the Dream cruiseline!</p>
            <p>This ship doesn’t just do it a little bit, either. For relaxation, get to Serenity Adult-Only Retreat, or step up to max relaxation at Cloud 9 Spa featuring great massages, thermal suites and more.You'll be floating on a Dream.</p>

        <p>The Liberty cruiseline has a message for you, and it’s “feel free to have fun!” Explore the ship and you’ll find food options galore, starting with two dining rooms, but definitely extending outdoors — there’s mouth-watering Guy Fieri burgers at Guy’s Burger Joint, plus the greatest tacos and burritos this side of the pier at BlueIguana Cantina. For delicious, but quick and easy, selections from the sea, get your chopsticks around all the good stuff at Bonsai Sushi Express...</p>

            <p>Catching a great sunrise isn’t just for early-risers. The Sunshine cruiseline, now sailing, has enough warm fun for everybody to bask in. And when we say “everybody”… well, here’s a ship that has so much vacation awesomeness to share with the world that it will have three homeports: Norfolk, Ft. Lauderdale and NYC, each featuring sailings with their own unique destinations...</p>
